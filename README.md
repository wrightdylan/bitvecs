# bitvecs

A simple library for dynamically sized binary arrays. This is slower, but more versatile than a static binary array. It is also up to 8 times more space efficient than using a vector of bools.

## Introduction

`bitvecs` is not a vector of bools, but a vector of u8s which represent complete bytes.
